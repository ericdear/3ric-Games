        This section of the 3ric Games website is for my co-op work term reports. I will be describing my goals and experiences in the workforce.

        <br><br>Clear Software is a full-stack custom software development company in Waterloo. They build software to help clients improve or replace their systems to launch their business forward. Clear Software builds any type of software for clients. Desktop, web and mobile apps, server databases, factory automation, payments, and robotics. The founder of Clear Software, Stephen Grinyer, works very hard to provide top quality software to Clear Softwareâ€™s clients, and is one of the best supervisors I have ever had.
        <br><br>My learning goals this work term were to improve my written and reading comprehension, my creativity, and most importantly, my knowledge about the technology that clear software uses, specifically NestJs and GraphQL to make the module, repository, resolver, service, and end to end tests for an entity, since that was my task at the beginning of the term. Learning more languages and expanding my knowledge in this field will benefit me for my next work term since many technology companies use NestJs and GraphQL. Looking back at my goals, all were successful in improving, but can still always be improved. I want to continue to improve my communication skills, along with expanding my knowledge in the technology field.
        <br><br>The first half of the term, I worked on making entities for the project the team was working on. I used NestJs and GraphQL to make the module, repository, resolver, service, and end to end tests for an entity. I learned this from the job since we were not taught NestJs or GraphQL in school. The second half of the term I was in QA, making tests that covered every area of the app. Later someone would run these tests to ensure the app was working properly and there were no bugs. It was really interesting to see agile development work in person instead of just reading about it in class.
        <br><br>Going forward, I will continue to learn more about different technologies and different programming languages. My time at Clear Software was very good and I learned a lot.
