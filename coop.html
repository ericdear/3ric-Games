        This section of the 3ric Games website is for my co-op work term reports. I will be describing my goals and experiences in the workforce.
        <br><br>Co-op term 1:

        <br><br>Clear Software is a full-stack custom software development company in Waterloo. They build software to help clients improve or replace their systems to launch their business forward. Clear Software builds any type of software for clients. Desktop, web and mobile apps, server databases, factory automation, payments, and robotics. The founder of Clear Software, Stephen Grinyer, works very hard to provide top quality software to Clear Software’s clients, and is one of the best supervisors I have ever had.
        <br><br>My learning goals this work term were to improve my written and reading comprehension, my creativity, and most importantly, my knowledge about the technology that clear software uses, specifically NestJs and GraphQL to make the module, repository, resolver, service, and end to end tests for an entity, since that was my task at the beginning of the term. Learning more languages and expanding my knowledge in this field will benefit me for my next work term since many technology companies use NestJs and GraphQL. Looking back at my goals, all were successful in improving, but can still always be improved. I want to continue to improve my communication skills, along with expanding my knowledge in the technology field.
        <br><br>The first half of the term, I worked on making entities for the project the team was working on. I used NestJs and GraphQL to make the module, repository, resolver, service, and end to end tests for an entity. I learned this from the job since we were not taught NestJs or GraphQL in school. The second half of the term I was in QA, making tests that covered every area of the app. Later someone would run these tests to ensure the app was working properly and there were no bugs. It was really interesting to see agile development work in person instead of just reading about it in class.
        <br><br>Going forward, I will continue to learn more about different technologies and different programming languages. My time at Clear Software was very good and I learned a lot.

        <br><br>Co-op term 2:
      
        <img src="it.png" alt="it" class="logo">

        <br><br>Canadian Hospital Specialties (CHS) is a medical device manufacturer and specialty distributor located in Oakville. The IT Team consists of 6 people who deal with technical issues over 5 locations. The Senior System Administrator, Ara, is who I worked closest with. He has been the best mentor I have had in the workplace, and is one of the most hard working people I know. Ara has stayed in at work till 2am, answers random work calls at 4am, and always shows his dedication to the company.
        <br><br>My learning goals this term was to improve my written communication, creativity, organization, and most importantly, my technical knowledge. During this work term, I worked with a bunch of new technology including, RF Scanning Guns, VPNs, Virtual Phone Software, and Laptop Configuration. These tasks have definitely benefited me for future work experiences as I now have way more knowledge in troubleshooting, problem solving, and hardware. Looking back at my goals, I have completed them, as I have improved a lot of my skills by working at CHS. However at the same time I want to and will continue to work on the same goals and keep improving and keep expanding my knowledge of technology when I come back to CHS in January.
        <br><br>During my time at CHS, I worked a lot with the RF Scanner Guns. They are used in the warehouse to scan items for shipping and receiving, and CHS is currently updating their ERP. Because of this I have been adding apps onto the scanners, and configuring them for the new system. I have also been helping with the back end, adding users, creating permissions and profiles for people to use the scanners. When I’m not working on the scanners, I configure laptops for new employees, and fix any issues that people in the company have with their laptops. Some issues I have had to fix were VPN issues, Phone calls not being routed to the right location, fixing printers, and setting up emulators. For this job, I needed very good problem solving skills which I have strongly developed during this co-op.
        <br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed my time at CHS. Before this co-op, I thought I only wanted to program and only be in the software and development fields of work. I now know that I also really like the System Administrator role, and look forward to working with CHS again in January.
